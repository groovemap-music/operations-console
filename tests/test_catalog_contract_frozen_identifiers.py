"""Frozen-identifier tests for the composed catalog-events adapter.

ADR 0005 (https://github.com/groovemap-music/design/blob/main/docs/adr/
0005-source-owned-catalog-ingestion.md) freezes this service's runtime AMQP
identifiers: a producer-contract promotion must never rename a durable
exchange, queue, dead-letter exchange, or dead-letter queue a consumer
already has messages under. FROZEN_NAMES below is a snapshot of exactly what
``dashboard.catalog_contract`` -- the hand-authored adapter that composes the
two promoted, source-owned producer contracts -- must keep producing for
every registered consumer. Every assertion here checks the adapter, and both
promoted contracts' own ``runtime_identifiers`` blocks, against that frozen
snapshot, so a future promotion that silently shifts a name is caught
immediately.
